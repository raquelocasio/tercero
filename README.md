Tercero is a responsive WordPress theme created with Underscores and the W3.CSS framework.

The idea is to keep the structure of the Underscores theme, and make it pretty using the styles of W3.CSS.

Each commit is synced to this repository, so you can follow along in my creation process.

For now, download the theme from this repository. This will (hopefully) be available from the WordPress theme repository when complete.
