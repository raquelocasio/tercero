Tercero is a responsive WordPress theme created with [Underscores](https://underscores.me/) and the [W3.CSS framework](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp).

The idea is to keep the structure of the Underscores theme, and make it pretty using the styles of W3.CSS.

Each commit is synced to this repository, so you can [follow along in my creation process](https://github.com/raquelocasio/tercero/commits/master).

For now, download the theme from this repository. This will (hopefully) be available from the WordPress theme repository when complete.
